    Discord Integration v2
    <h1>Notice</h1>
    <br>
This repo is a fork of the original JetBrains Discord Integration plugin, as its owner has been inactive for a while. I will try to keep it up to date with the latest versions of discord and jetbrains IDEs, and fix any issues that may arise.<br>
Feel free to open an issue if you have any problems with the plugin, or if you have any suggestions.<br>
Feel free to open a pull request if you want to contribute to the project.<br>
<br>
Note : The plugin is not available on the JetBrains plugin repository yet.
